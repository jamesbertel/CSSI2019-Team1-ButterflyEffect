_Start_
...
You've crashed into the forest late at night. You have no memory of what happened or who you are, but lost in the forest with your pet dog, {{DOG}}
-Search plane-
You've found a flashlight and an empty backpack.
--Wait Till Morning
--Dog comforts--
{{DOG}} went up to you to comfort you.
-Dark Rustling-
You hear a mysterious rustling in the bush. Should you check on it?
--Approach it--
The beast of the forest killed you
--Quietly go back in plane--
It's best if you hide for now since it's dark and have no idea what's out there.
