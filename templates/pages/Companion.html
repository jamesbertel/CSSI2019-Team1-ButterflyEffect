   var story = [0"Your eyes shoot open to the distinct cold, wet feeling hitting your cheek. Cold sweat drips down your furrowed brow. You tilt your head ever so slightly to the left to see piercing brown eyes looking back at you. <br><br> Its Duke. <br><br> Thoughts begin to rush into your head. Where are you? Memories of you childhood and adolescence shoot back into your head, but your thoughts come to a halt, when you feel the stinging sensation against you leg. <br><br> You look down and around at your surroundings. You see metal tiles torn and strewn about the cabin of your now destroyed aircraft. Your leg is slightly injured from the impact. You know you’ll recover just fine with some tape and gauze. But for now you have to figure out where to go next. <br> Duke kneels down at your side. <br><br> Where to next?",

  1 "After a quick look around you see a tattered worn-down knapsack hanging from broken electrical  wires. You search the cabins compartments and stumble across a half-shattered flashlight. Good enough, but the exhaustion is starting to get to you.",

   2"You step out the cavernous hole made from the demolished pilot wing. The overgrown grass sways above your knees. Large sequoia trees cover the ample sky above, their branches sprouting every direction. New sights and smells overwhelm your senses. You feel your heartbeat quicken, your environment makes you shudder. Duke seems to be enjoying himself. You see him smelling every plant, bush and tree in sight until he makes a sudden stop and begins trailing off deeper into the forest. You’re feeling cold and alone.",

  3 "You mustn't die of hypothermia, Duke is just exploring anyway. You step over the bounds of overgrown grass, dodging low hanging branches and ascending over fallen timber. Along the way picking up dry leaves and small twigs to use as kindle. Your hear the fibers in the tree twist and bend until an echoing crunch emanates from its severed stump. You move through the forest as swiftly as possible. Your callused hands reach for another branch when you hear a deafening, bitter outcry. It rolls across your ears like thunder from the clouds. You hear the sporadic flaps spring past the tall trees. The ground vibrates a low hum. Your unable to tell if it’s from the screech before or the creatures its' scared off.",

  4 "You inch your way further into the forest following the hollow screech you heard earlier. Your footsteps are agile. Duke trails behind you, matching your pace. You see tree’s breeze past you, your visions a hazy blur. What if it was a call for help? What if it is your call for help? A chance for rescue was one worth taking. These hopeful thoughts linger on your mind. Your optimism fuels your tenacity, your legs feel lighter than ever, but slowly your affirmations waste away. Hopeful thinking is not enough for survival. A scream as horrid as the one you heard isn't a rescue call it’s suici- <br><br> The corner of your eye... It’s just a glimpse. You see it. It towers at twice your size. It’s no animal, and it’s certainly not human. Adrenaline pumps into your heart, the silence eats away at your sanity. You only have time for instinct.",

  5"Your mind doesn’t have time to catch up with your legs. You find yourself sprinting against the frigid wind. Heat rushes through your body. You pound your legs into the ground as if your strength could affect the laws of friction. Your wounds scream out in pain but you’re unable to feel it. Your adrenaline keeps you moving, the sound of footsteps keeps you running. ",

  6 "Your breaths are short and sharp, your mind feels clouded through your lack of oxygen. You want to scream but you have no air for it. Your tear ducts begin to burn-tears welling out, but the wind dries them within seconds. Even the forest ignores your pleads for help. You feel your stamina depleting with each passing step, your mind confirms your position. <br><br> You can’t go any further. <br><br> You stand there, the sound of it’s beating steps growing closer. You want to shut your eyes but you remain paralyzed. In draws near you, It’s skin a pale, sickly color. Its body resembles your own framework, however, its eyes are sunken deep into its skull, long bruised arms that drag against the floor - its ribs protrude out as if it hasn’t eaten in days. <br><br> You exhale one...last...time.",

  7 "Your eyes widen with fear, your instinct tells you to hide. You dart across the woodlands, the sound of snarls following behind. Your lungs burning in pain. You feel as though you might faint. Rushing past the trees, the sounds of snapping twigs breaking beneath your feet. Every snap and crunch suddenly becoming louder until your muddled with noise. You can no longer hear your thoughts, only snaps and breaks",

   8"You freeze into place. Its eyes meet your own, but you feel no life from them, they are white, hollow spheres- ruthless in nature, but they look right past you. Pass your sweating body and its’ pulsing heart, pass the desperation in your eyes. You hold your breath, your chest pounding in and out as you bind it. You don’t make a move, nor a sound. Your eyes refusing to look away from its own. You notice Its skin is a pale, sickly color. How Its body resembles your own framework, but its eyes are sunken deep into its skull. Its mouth opens, unhinging itself like a snake to reveal its rows of jagged and cleft teeth that spiral down into the back of its neck. It exhales. Its hot breath cloaks your face, invading your nose with the stench of its previous prey. Abrupt chirps are heard in the distance, immediately it throws its head back with a gritting violent screech and bounds towards the chirps. You exhale...Slumping against the collapsed log, you cry in complete silence, your chest burning, eyes beginning to swell up - tears start steaming off your face. Duke's wistful eyes look into your own. You refuse to die here.",

   9"Your mouth is dry and stale, you feel worn-out and weak. You don’t allow yourself to rest out of fear that you might not wake up. There's been no source of water ever since you crashed, and if you don’t find some soon you might die of dehydration. Duke whines. He must be thirsty as well. You reach over to hold his somber head in your hands, reassuring him that you’ll survive. That you both will. <br><br> As you drag yourself off the ground, duke lets you stabilize yourself on him, aiding you as you walk. Twenty minutes goes by when you begin to hear the sounds of forest creatures scurrying around. Nature allows you a few seconds of peace and a new opportunity. To the left, you hear the vibration of rushing water. To the right is a drum of splashes and drips. <br><br> Where will you go next?",

   10"If your memory serves you well rushing water leads to rivers which can lead to oceans. <br><br> You follow to the tune of water crashing against the rock beds, and within a couple of minutes, you're greeted with a large stream. Your lost affirmations of hope return to you. You grin ferociously into the sun. Running alongside duke downstream where the river terrain expands, soon the overbearing decrepit trees start to disperse, the coarse grassy lands you run on turn to rock and sand. In the distance you see a small brown speck, you pick up your pace. Laughing and shouting at duke to keep up. The speck grows into a small cabin resting aside the water. You feel euphoria as you rush to the cabin, bursting through the wooden door with ease to meet a group of, now distraught, lumberman. Shouting nonsense to them about a beast that lives in the woods, a crashed plane and your survival. You lose your breath and stare at them expressionless. The smile never leaving your face as your mind fades out of consciousness. <br><br> [They tend to your wounds, call 911, all that jazz you saved and whatever]",
   11"You weave between trees, following the call of nature and the soft dripping taps of water hitting the stones. It’s only thirty meters ahead when you finally reach the destination of the dripping sound.
You locate a small-scale quaint pond. A single kestrel bathes itself. Despite your parchedness and aching body, you feel quite at peace.",
   12"You limp over to the edge of the pond, kneel to the ground and splash the refreshing crisp water against your face. You feel the nerves in your body unwind at its touch. Cupping both your muddy hands together and diving them into the water before reeling them back to your face to lap at the droplets before they drain through your loose grip. You stay hunched over the pool of water until you've completely quenched your thirst. You prop yourself against a large boulder and rest while you can... Your jolted awake. A twisting sensation erupts in your stomach. It gurgles at you in agony. You grip at your intestines before peeling over and hitting the ground, folding yourself into a fetal position. Your head throbs as your body convulses on the floor. You roll your head to the side and gag, your stomach bubbles, a lump forms in your throat. Saliva spills out of your mouth, you try putting pressure on your abdomen to drive out the source, the dull pain causing you to gag more. You heave in and out until you finally regurgitate, the taste of your own stomach acid filling your mouth. Your body overheats covering you in sweat, letting out a final cry you plead to an audience that was never there.",
